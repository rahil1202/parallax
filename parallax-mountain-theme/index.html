        <h1>THE STORY OF LIFE</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Life brings us as many joyful moments as it does downfalls, and although there are days we wish there
                was a manual to follow, it simply wouldn’t be the same without the spontaneity. The journey of life may
                not become easier as we grow older, but we do seem to understand it better as our perspectives evolve.
                Whether you’re embarking on a new adventure right out of school or you want to explore different paths
                in your personal life, it’s never too late to change what the future looks like.Since we as human beings
                developed the ability to think rationally and analyze our surroundings, we have been curious about why
                things are the way that they are.

        <h1>WHY A REASON ?</h1>
        <p> Everything happens for a reason. From every experience of your life you will see the shadow can't beat the
            sun, sadness can't beat happiness, anger can't beat smile, frustration can't beat patience, hate can't beat
            love, inhumanity can't beat kindness, failure can't beat success.

            <p> Why not take a cup of coffee to taste the morning breeze?
                It will let you know that how simple life can create a beautiful moment.
                Don't worry if you feel sad because you can easily find beautiful moments from anywhere.
                Beautiful moments belong to happiness.
